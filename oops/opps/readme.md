>>1 Class and objects
    1.1 Class consist of blocks, constructor, variables, methods, inner classes and inner interfaces
    1.2 Object  is a real world entities 
        ex: A smartphone..  have storage, battary type, camera features ans so on.
        >>To create a object we use "NEW" keyword


>>2 Access Modeifier
    2.1.Default A.M.
        is only accessable whithin the package, it cannot be accessable outside of the package.
    2.2.Private A.M.
        is only Can accessable within the class.
    3.3.Public A.M.
        is accessable from any class or package.
    3.4.Protected A.M.
        can be accessed witthin its own package or outside of package in sub class of its class in the another package.


>>3 Setters and getters
    3.1Getters and Setters in java are two methods used for fetching and updating the value of a variable. 
    3.2getter is use to print the updated value of the object.
    3.3setter is use for update the value of the object.


>>4 Constructor
    Constructor is a function that creates a new objects
    Constructor dosent have any return type
    it simply construct object with entities
    You can have multiple constructor
    we can't call a constructor 2 times on an object. we can constructor only one time on a obj  ect

>>5 Inherintance 
    The class that inherits properties from another class is called inherentance
    >>To inherent a a class in any other class we use "extend" keyword while creating a new class.

>>6 Super Key
    super is used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
    i.e. we are already having a print function in parent c 
    so we can directly call that function from super class to sub class by using "Super" Key word.
