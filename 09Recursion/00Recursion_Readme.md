>> 00 Recursion 
      is computer science is a method where the solution to a problem depends
      on solution to smaller instances of the same problem.

      in short-
      >>Recursion is a function calling itself.

>> 01 Base Case
      is a simplest problem to solve.
      base case is to terminate the loop to avoid stack overflow (avoid becoming an infinite recursion).
